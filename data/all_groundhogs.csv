Penny’s predictions are based on what side of her display cage she moves to, one side signifying early spring and the other six more weeks winter. Brevard Mayor Maureen Copelof says “Pisgah Penny has established herself as a beloved and valued member of this community who openly asserts her love for Brevard,” while “Punxsutawney Phil has established himself as, let’s be honest, an ill tempered, unreliable predictor.”",https://groundhog-day.com/images/ghogs/pisgah-penny.jpeg,3
