      "description": "Concord Charlie is a presumed groundhog from Athens, West Virginia. In a tradition dating back to 1978, Charlie meets with the President of Concord University and relays his predictions regarding the duration of winter. The President then joins a slew of guests at the University’s annual Groundhog Day Breakfast and shares Charlie’s predictions. Notably, Charlie has never been seen by anyone except the President and presumably other university staff; we believe him to be a groundhog based on these few eyewitness accounts.",

      "description": "Mojave Max is a desert tortoise prognosticator who heralds spring’s arrival in Nevada. Groundhogs, who are famously not very accurate at making bets, avoid Las Vegas due to the heat and amount of money they would lose. Max, however, is right at home in the Nevada desert. Every year, Max enters a burrow to ‘brumate’ (hibernation for reptiles) throughout winter and emerges in the spring. Groundhog Day marks the start of “Mojave Max Watch,” a contest for elementary school students to guess the tortoise’s emergence date. Max’s emergence is “the preeminent indicator of spring-like weather in Southern Nevada and the west coast.” GROUNDHOG-DAY.com interprets Max’s predictions based on if he emerges on March 16 or later, which is 6 weeks after Groundhog Day.",

The event was canceled in 2021 and 2022 due to the pandemic, but Sammi returned for a prediction in 2023. The prediction ritual starts with members of the lodge gathering around Sammi, and then giving a welcome, a prayer and a prediction in both English and Pennsylvania Dutch. When he is not the centre of attention on February 2nd, Sammi resides in the unbelievably-named community of Kunkletown.",

Though he is now taxidermied, his eternal pose — clutching a corn cob amid a scattering of additional cobs — has sparked widespread speculation about his affinity for corn. His lively corn-related tweets only fuel this perception. Phil’s handlers have remarked that they’re on a quest for a “magic elixir” to reanimate him back to life. Until that day comes, their decisions rely on carefully interpreting his ‘non-verbals:’ eye contact, facial expressions, posture, and the intensity of his ever-watchful gaze.",

Unlike traditional groundhogs, Doug doesn’t use his shadow, but rather an ‘interpretive dance’ Groundhogese variation (featuring hand movements, wiggles and head shakes) to deliver his prognostication to the attendant Burrow Master and Shadow Keeper. And with great results: a prior Burrow Master said Doug “has been making predictions for about 30 years and has always been 100 percent accurate.”",

If he does, it’s an early spring. If he doesn’t, it’s six more weeks of winter.”",

Here is his statement: “Honestly, it’s a lot of stress having the whole world depend on you to predict the weather and I needed to take a break. I’ve really been enjoying my time out of the spotlight and have been focusing on Zoo Boise’s Conservation Fund. I have a beautiful corner office in my burrow and spend most of my day helping zoo staff come up with innovative ways to raise money to help protects animals all over the world.”",

If he doesn’t, don’t bring your swimsuits out yet.” While groundhogs have a spotty record of predictions, “alligators tell the truth. They’ve been around for millions and millions of years. That’s why we truly believe alligators know when to eat.” Perhaps unfairly, considering Al’s record-setting heft, Saurage insists that there is no need to check with an ‘overgrown hedgehog.’",

Casimir — aka, The Polish Prince of Felines — was found abandoned as a kitten on the footsteps of Cleveland’s St. Casimir Polish Church in 2012. Master of Ceremonies John Niedzialek interprets Casimir’s forecast based on the way he eats his yearly pierogis. If he eats them sloppily, Cleveland is in for a long, messy spring; if Casimir eats them normally, then it’s winter as usual; and if he swallows the pierogis in one gulp, the region can look forward to a warm coming summer. Since Casimir’s predictions are a little unconventional, we try our best to fit them into the “spring/winter” dichotomy we prefer on GROUNDHOG-DAY.com.",

Allen was a bit of a health nut who followed a clean vegetarian diet of leafy greens, carrots, beets, and tomatoes, and kept in shape with digging-centric workouts. Allen was also particularly keen on yoga and meditation, which contributed to his calm and easy-going personality.",
